### 🧠 **Java Kata Playground**

Welcome to my **Java Kata Playground** — a collection of small but powerful Java challenges I solve daily to sharpen my fundamentals, explore common coding patterns, and train my brain 🧩

---

### 🏁 **Why This Repo?**

- ✅ Practice core **Java syntax** and **grammar**
- ✅ Reinforce **collections**, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, loops, conditionals, etc.
- ✅ Train problem-solving skills through daily small challenges
- ✅ Build a consistent routine of **writing, testing, and reviewing Java code**
- ✅ Eventually expand to include **LeetCode-style** problems (arrays, strings, recursion, etc.)

---

### 📦 **Structure**

- `MapKata.java` — Challenges using `HashMap`  
- `SetKata.java` — Challenges using `HashSet`  
- `MapKataTest.java`, `SetKataTest.java` — JUnit tests for each challenge  

---

### 🧪 **Test-Driven Practice**

All solutions are written with **JUnit 5 tests** to validate correctness, handle edge cases, and build testing discipline.

---

### 🚀 **Next Goals**

- Add more **LeetCode-style problems**
- Explore `List`, `Queue`, `Stack`, and `TreeMap`
- Add Javadoc comments for practice
- Refactor when needed for better readability

---

### 🧠 Example Topics Covered So Far

- First non-repeating/repeating characters  
- Word frequency maps  
- Anagram grouping  
- Deduplication while preserving order  
- Frequency-based sorting  
- HashMap + logic practice

---

### 🔁 Daily Kata Philosophy

This repo is my way of turning **Java practice into a daily habit**. No pressure. No perfect code. Just regular, consistent, meaningful brain workouts.
